Almost all beginner developers are wondering the same thing when starting out:

> What programming language should I learn in 20XX?

The problem is, **that's the wrong question entirely**.

Starting out thinking about what programming languages you want to learn is the quickest
way to end up burnt out and unproductive. Or even worse, you could end up wasting years of your life
and thousands of dollars pursuing a career that you don't really want.

I'm speaking from experience.

When I first got started with programming, I thought that I had to go to school and get a
Computer Science degree to have enough skills to make money.

So I took the path and worked my ass off to get internships, do freelance work, AI research, make websites, and teach other developers all so I could start making some money with code.

Throughout the process I learned how to code in C, Python, Java, JavaScript, Elixir, HTML, CSS, and Swift.
I don't say that to brag. In fact, by learning all those languages and working in so many different areas,
I wasted a massive amount of time getting virtually nowhere.

Of course I learned a lot, but I wasn't any closer to where I really wanted to be as a developer and entrepreneur.

If I knew what I know now, I would have taken a completely different path. That's what I want to share with you now.

## What is your long term vision

When you get started, the first thing you should ask yourself is **what is your long term vision**?

* Do you want to rake in passive income building apps and software products?
* Do you want to discover the next breakthroughs in Quatum Computing and AI?
* Do you want to travel the world as a remote developer?
* Do you want to be a content creator who educates and guides beginner developers?

This is your opportunity to think about your ideal situation. What is it that you feel like best suits you in the long run?

Once you have a target that you're shooting for, you can then work backwards and figure out what you should do today.

If you're having a hard time figuring it out, that's normal. Coming up with a vision for what you want can take time. I learned by spending years trying out different paths until I learned how to combine my passion for helping others and creating into what I do now.

What's important is not to get too fixated on coming up with the most perfect vision, but coming up with the best thing you can imagine and taking action. Your vision will change anyway as you get more exposure to what's out there and become more comfortable
accepting what you really want for yourself.

Another trick is to find someone who is doing what you want to do (or close enough) and study them aggressively. Google them and read and watch everything they do.

If you're brave enough, you can reach out to them on Twitter or wherever they talk to people and see what you can offer them. Create something or do something that will benefit them in some way and use that to get on their radar.

This might feel a little stalker-ish, but this is pretty much the best way to discover how they got where they are today and reverse-engineer their life to do even better.

## What are your current needs

The next big question is **what are your current needs**?

This question is all about being realistic and recognizing your constraints. A 15 year high school freshman has very different
concerns than a 35 year old looking to transition careers.

This should be common sense, but far too often people give advice without considering a person's unique situation. In this step
you should take a very good look at your network, education, current skills, and passions before diving too deep into anything.

The two biggest factors in evaluating your needs are time & money. The less money you have, the more patience you will need because
you will have to use time to figure out the best thing for you.

The more money, the more you can afford to skip over the BS and learn from people who are doing.

## Are you willing to commit

The last, and arguably most important question, is **are you willing to commit to this journey for at least the next 3 years**?

This is a tough one because a lot of things will happen and change in that time period. However, this is crucial for achieving
the type of success that you really want.

This doesn't mean that it will take 3 years to see results. Many people see results within 6 months to a year of pursuing a change.
The important thing is not how long it takes, but having the mindset to stay consistent and faithfully take steps that will
push you towards the types of results that you want to see.

This is the main reason why getting step 1 down is so crucial. If you can't get into a commitment mindset, then you are completely
depending on luck to create the perfect life for you. If that's how you think, I hope the best for you, but I doubt you will see the
results you are really hoping for.

## What language to pick

Programming languages are the same way. They are simply tools to help you create the types of projects
in a field that most fits what you hope to get out of your life.

* If you want to make iOS apps, pick up Swift.
* If you want to build websites, learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
* If you want to make video games: C++ and C# are the go to.

Development is a skill that is flexible enough to fit a wide variety of lifestyles and personalities. Before you even think
about the programming language to learn, there are a few questions you should ask yourself:

1. Why do I want to code?
2. What do I need to learn to accomplish that?

These two questions are fundamental in choosing a path that will reflect your skills the best. Not having an answer to both
questions will lead to quickly getting burnt out or wasting time learning things that won't help you accomplish your goals.

Let's dive deeper into both.

## Why do I want to code

You may have discovered code after hearing about how much money you can make with it.

When I first got started as a developer, I researched what careers you could have. I have more a business mind, so I looked into
the best languages to learn as a freelance developer. Through my research, I learned that their are a ton of developers who
develop themes and do Wordpress development.

So that's what I jumped into.

What I didn't consider was that there a re
